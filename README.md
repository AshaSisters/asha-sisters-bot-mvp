## User Journey

1. **Language Selection**: Users select their preferred language (English, Shona, IsiNdebele).
2. **Role Selection**: Users choose whether they are a woman in business, youth entrepreneur, or referring a sister.
3. **Age and Gender**: Users are prompted to enter their age and gender to tailor content.
4. **Access to Modules**: Based on the user's role and selection, they gain access to the four modules:
   - Products
   - Training
   - Maternal Health
   - Distributor Network


## Phase 1 Modules

### 1. Product Access (PUE)
Users can learn about solar products, payment plans, and apply for discounts. The module also offers educational content for promoting solar products.
### 2. Entrepreneurial Training
This module targets women entrepreneurs, guiding them through entrepreneurial skills and solar technical training. Users are asked to provide their location, education level, and funding status.
### 3. Maternal Health Tips
A key feature of the bot is to offer health tips to pregnant women and adolescent girls. The bot provides weekly health tips and encourages clinic visits for pregnant women. Users can earn a 20% discount code for solar products if they provide proof of their clinic visit.
### 4. Distributor Network
Users interested in becoming distributors can apply through this module. It collects personal details and interests to match applicants with the right distributor opportunities.

## Phase 2: Future Enhancements

### 1. **PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Integration**
We plan to integrate PAYG solutions, allowing users to access solar products with flexible payment options. This phase will also include a system for tracking PAYG payments and progress.
### 2. **Blockchain Integration for Carbon Credits**
To further enhance the sustainability and impact of the products, we will integrate blockchain technology to allow users to track their contributions to carbon credit generation.
### 3. **USSD Support**
Expanding the accessibility of the bot to users without smartphones, USSD functionality will allow those with basic mobile phones to interact with the system.
### 4. **Expanded Modules**
The bot will expand with more educational content, resources, and enhanced customer support features.
